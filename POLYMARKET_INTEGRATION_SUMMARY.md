# 🚀 Polymarket Integration - Complete Implementation Summary

## 📋 Overview

Successfully integrated Polymarket data into your existing Market Dashboards project, creating a unified platform that supports both Kalshi and Polymarket prediction markets.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### **Phase 1: Test & Validation** ✅
- **API Connectivity Test**: Verified Polymarket Gamma API access
- **Data Structure Analysis**: Analyzed 69 fields from Polymarket markets
- **DuckDB Compatibility**: Confirmed data can be stored in existing database structure
- **Data Compatibility**: Mapped Polymarket fields to existing Kalshi structure

### **Phase 2: Architecture Integration** ✅
- **New Client Module**: Created `polymarket_client.py` with full API client
- **Data Normalization**: Implemented field mapping and data transformation
- **Refresh Scripts**: Extended refresh system for Polymarket data
- **Unified Data Layer**: Added functions to combine both data sources

### **Phase 3: UI Integration** ✅
- **Data Source Toggle**: Added sidebar selector for Kalshi/Polymarket/Both
- **Unified Dashboard**: Updated main Dashboard.py with multi-source support
- **Status Display**: Shows market counts and last update times for each source
- **Batch Refresh**: Created `refresh_all_data.bat` for easy data updates

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Data Flow**
```
Polymarket API → polymarket_client.py → Data Normalization → Parquet Storage → Unified Access Functions → Dashboard UI
```

### **Key Components**
1. **`polymarket_client.py`**: Handles API calls and rate limiting
2. **`utils.py`**: Extended with unified data access functions
3. **`scripts/refresh_polymarket.py`**: Fetches and stores Polymarket data
4. **`Dashboard.py`**: Updated with data source selection
5. **`refresh_all_data.bat`**: One-click refresh for both sources

### **Data Storage**
- **Kalshi**: `data/active_markets.parquet` (4,143 markets)
- **Polymarket**: `data/polymarket_markets.parquet` (20 markets)
- **Combined**: Unified access through `get_unified_markets()`

## 📊 Data Structure Mapping

### **Polymarket → Normalized Fields**
| Polymarket Field | Normalized Field | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|-------|
| `id` | `market_id` | Unique identifier |
| `question` | `title` | Market question |
| `category` | `category` | Market category |
| `outcomes` | `outcomes` | JSON array of outcomes |
| `outcomePrices` | `outcome_prices` | JSON object of prices |
| `lastTradePrice` | `last_price` | Last traded price |
| `bestBid` | `yes_bid` | Best bid price |
| `bestAsk` | `yes_ask` | Best ask price |
| `volume24hr` | `volume_24h` | 24-hour volume |
| `liquidityNum` | `liquidity` | Available liquidity |

### **Special Handling**
- **Outcomes**: Parsed from JSON strings to Python lists
- **Dates**: Converted from ISO format to datetime objects
- **Status**: Transformed from active/closed to unified status
- **Source Identification**: Added `data_source` and `source_id` fields

## 🔧 Usage Instructions

### **1. Refresh Data**
```bash
# Refresh both sources
refresh_all_data.bat

# Or refresh individually
python scripts/refresh_parquets.py        # Kalshi
python scripts/refresh_polymarket.py      # Polymarket
```

### **2. Run Dashboard**
```bash
streamlit run Dashboard.py
```

### **3. Select Data Sources**
- Use sidebar to choose: Kalshi, Polymarket, or Both
- View real-time status and market counts
- Switch between sources seamlessly

### **4. Access Data Programmatically**
```python
from utils import get_unified_markets, get_markets_by_source

# Get all markets from both sources
all_markets = get_unified_markets()

# Get only Polymarket markets
polymarket_markets = get_markets_by_source('polymarket')

# Get only Kalshi markets
kalshi_markets = get_markets_by_source('kalshi')
```

## 📈 Current Status

### **Data Sources Available**
- ✅ **Kalshi**: 4,143 markets, fully integrated
- ✅ **Polymarket**: 20 markets, fully integrated
